      At Moore AI, we believe AI should feel less like hype and more like help. We're a team of practical engineers and strategic thinkers, building real solutions for real businesses. Whether you're automating daily workflows or launching a next-gen product, we bring clarity, speed, and focus to every stage.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
      We don’t do one-size-fits-all. Every system we build is tailored to your needs, goals, and team. From startups moving fast to enterprises ready to scale, we work side-by-side, not just as developers, but as long-term partners you can trust.
